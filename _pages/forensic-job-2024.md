Research Fellow - Human-Computer Interaction in Policing and Digital Forensics (UCL <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/pay-benefits/salary-scales">Pay Grade</a> 7)
======

I am seeking to recruit a Research Fellow in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Policing and Digital Forensics to work on an exciting new ESRC funded project working with three Police agencies. You would explore existing practices, resources, challenges, and identify user needs around the search and seizure of digital evidence (e.g., smart phones, laptops) across two crime types (homicide, stalking and harassment). The sucessful candidate would work within an interdisaplinary team of academics, and work alongside a criminologist to review criminal case material, and conduct and analyse interviews. The sucessful candidate would lead the design of a series of early-stage design prototypes and run workshops with user-groups and stakeholders to evaluate these designs. 

Ultimatly, this project will work towards the development of a smart digital forensic advisor (SDFA) tool to support first responders conducting digital evidence triage at-scene to reducing backlog in digital devices waiting to be examined, and to create more consistent and evidence informed practices around the initial seizure of digital evidence. 

This position will be funded for 1 year (starting 1 March 2024) in the first instance. The successful candidate would be expected to work a minimum of two days at our central London campus, with the option to work the remaining time from home. <b>Due to security vetting requirements, candidates must have been resident in the UK for 3 years from 1 March 2024.</b> There would also be some work-related travel required to perform field work data collection (London, Nottinghamshire, Coventry). Appointment at Grade 7 is dependent upon having been awarded a PhD; if this is not the case, initial appointment will be at Research Assistant Grade 6B (Salary £37,332 - £39,980 per annum, including London Allowance) with payment at Grade 7 being backdated to the date of final submission of the PhD thesis (including corrections). 

If you are an HCI researcher with experience with qualitative methods and are interested in this excisting project then please get in touch with Dr Mark Warner.

I will be holding an online information session via Zoom on the 10th January 2024 (11:00 - 12:00) https://ucl.zoom.us/j/92684181758?pwd=RGIrMXExZVFxb1VCZytSWDU3dHdydz09 (Meeting ID: 926 8418 1758
