I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Information Security in the Computer Science Department at University College London (UCL), and am part of the Information Security Research Group (<a href="https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk">sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk</a>). 

In addition to my computer science background, I have an interest in the fields of psychology and sociology. I draw from these disciplines in my research which is centred around understanding and improving various online social interactions and computer and AI-mediated communication behaviours. In particular, I am interested in how social computing technologies can be designed to reduce online harms such as cyberbullying, child abuse, and misinformation spread. Whilst this is my primary area of research, I am also interested in research at the intersection of technology, crime and policing having previously spent over 10 years working within digital policing/forensics.

Current research projects
======
- Usability and User Experience of Content Report Tools (UseCRT): This project is investigating the usability and user experience of online content reporting tools design to support people to report incidents of harassment (REPHRAIN funded)
- Towards a Smart Digital Forensic Triage Tool to Support Police First Responders (TRIAGE) - ESRC funded project starting March 2024.
- Child Sexual Abuse Conversation Dataset (CSAC): The development of a child sexual abuse conversation dataset, this project will lead to advances in our understanding of how perpetrators of child sex grooming engage online with young people through computer-mediated communication tools and platforms. The dataset will, for the first time, provide researchers with access to real-world grooming conversations (offender side only), laying the foundations for work into reactive and proactive mechanisms for limiting this behaviour across platforms, and improving digital investigation workflows (REPHRAIN Funded).
- Effective warnings to prevent Authorised Push Payment (APP) frauds: This project is investigating the effectiveness of existing online banking warnings at preventing APP fraud payments, and developing and evaluating novel warning mechanisms.
- Usable Privacy in Female Health Apps: This project is exploring usable privacy mechanisms within female health apps (Google Faculty Award Funded).
- Key2Kindness (REPHRAIN funded): This interdisciplinary project is investigating the role of proactive hate speech awareness mechanisms in reducing the production of hate speech across online social platforms (REPHRAIN Funded).

Completed projects
======
- Observatory for Monitoring Data Driven Approach to COVID-19 (AHRC): OMDDAC researched data-driven approaches to Covid-19, focusing on legal, ethical, policy and operational/technical challenges. Ther project analysed key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collated lessons learned throughout the pandemic by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, representative public surveys and practitioner-focussed guidelines.

- Errors and Regrets in CMC (UCL CS): This project explored errors and regretful messages within messaging applications. In particular, it focused on understanding how users both use and perceive the use of the message "delete for all" functional introduced across most modern day instant messaging applications.

- Privacy unravelling in online social environments (Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellowship): drawing on theory from the fields of psychology, economics, sociology, and evolutionary biology, to understand people’s online social behaviours. This work was especially interested in how people manage privacy around sensitive information in online social spaces and in particular, the impact non-disclosures can have through the social effect of privacy unravelling.

Work Experience
======
Prior to academia, I worked as an advisor in digital forensics for a criminal investigations department in the Middle East. I was responsible for developing enhanced capabilities for extracting, analysing, and processing data from electronic devices in criminal investigations. Prior to this, I was working for various law enforcement agencies within the UK, focused on developing advanced mobile forensics data recovery techniques.
