I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Information Security in the computer and sciences department at University College London (UCL), and am part of the information security research group (Infosec). 

In addition to my computer science background, I have an interest in the fields of psychology and sociology. I draw from these disciplines in my research which is centred around understanding and improving various online social interactions and computer and AI-mediated communication behaviours. In particular, I am interested in how social computing technologies can be designed to reduce online harms such as cyberbullying and misinformation spread. Whilst this is primarily research focus, I am also interested in research at the intersection of technology, crime and policing having previously spent over 10 years working within digital policing. 

Current research projects
======
- Key2Kindness (REPHRAIN funded): This interdisciplinary project is investigating the role of proactive hate speech awareness mechanisms in reducing the production of hate speech across online social platforms.

Current PhD Supervision
======
- Lauren Scott (PhD Candidate) - Conducting social computing research into how family networks and affected by online misinformation, and how they could act as a resource to help reduce its impact. 

I am currently accepting PhD students.

Completed projects
======
- Observatory for Monitoring Data Driven Approach to COVID-19 (AHRC): OMDDAC researched data-driven approaches to Covid-19, focusing on legal, ethical, policy and operational/technical challenges. Ther project analysed key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collated lessons learned throughout the pandemic by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, representative public surveys and practitioner-focussed guidelines. <a href="https://www.omddac.org.uk/publications/">OMDDAC Publications</a>

- Errors and Regrets in CMC (UCL CS): This project explored errors and regretful messages within messaging applications. In particular, it focused on understanding how users both use and perceive the use of the message "delete for all" functional introduced across most modern day instant messaging applications. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445118">chi'21</a>]

- Privacy unravelling in online social environments (Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellowship): drawing on theory from the fields of psychology, economics, sociology, and evolutionary biology, to understand people’s online social behaviours. This work was especially interested in how people manage privacy around sensitive information in online social spaces and in particular, the impact non-disclosures can have through the social effect of privacy unravelling.

Prior to academia, I worked as an advisor in digital forensics for a criminal investigations department in the Middle East. I was responsible for developing enhanced capabilities for extracting, analysing, and processing data from electronic devices in criminal investigations. Prior to this, I was working for various law enforcement agencies within the UK, focused on developing advanced mobile forensics data recovery techniques.

Latest Updates News
======
- I started a new role as Lecturer in Information Security at University College London (UCL) as of September 2022. 
- I have had a research project funded through REPHRAIN, this project aims to understand whether a keyboard could be designed to provide guidance and support to people as they type, and to notify them of any harmful content contained within the message in order to reduce the likelihood of them pressing send.
- I had a paper accepted to CHI'21 titled “Oops...”: Mobile Message Deletion in Conversation Error and Regret Remediation. This paper explored people's use of the message delete function in mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

PhD Supervision
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
