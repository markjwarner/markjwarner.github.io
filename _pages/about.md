I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Information Security in the computer and sciences department at University College London (UCL), and am part of the information security research group (Infosec). 

In addition to my computer science background, I have an interest in the fields of psychology and sociology. I draw from these disciplines in my research which is centred around understanding and improving various online social interactions and computer and AI-mediated communication behaviours. In particular, I am interested in how social computing technologies can be designed to reduce online harms such as cyberbullying and misinformation spread. Whilst this is primarily research focus, I am also interested in research at the intersection of technology, crime and policing having previously spent over 10 years working within digital policing. 

Current research projects
======
- Effective warnings to prevent Authorised Push Payment (APP): This project is investigating the effectiveness of existing warnings at preventing APP fraud payments, and developing and evaluating novel warning mechanisms.
- Usable Privacy in Female Health Apps (Google Faculty Award): This project is exploring usable privacy mechanisms within female health apps.
- Key2Kindness (REPHRAIN funded): This interdisciplinary project is investigating the role of proactive hate speech awareness mechanisms in reducing the production of hate speech across online social platforms.

Current PhD Supervision
======
- Lauren Scott (PhD Candidate) - Conducting social computing research into how family networks and affected by online misinformation, and how they could act as a resource to help reduce its impact. 

I am currently accepting PhD students.

Completed projects
======
- Observatory for Monitoring Data Driven Approach to COVID-19 (AHRC): OMDDAC researched data-driven approaches to Covid-19, focusing on legal, ethical, policy and operational/technical challenges. Ther project analysed key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collated lessons learned throughout the pandemic by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, representative public surveys and practitioner-focussed guidelines. <a href="https://www.omddac.org.uk/publications/">OMDDAC Publications</a>

- Errors and Regrets in CMC (UCL CS): This project explored errors and regretful messages within messaging applications. In particular, it focused on understanding how users both use and perceive the use of the message "delete for all" functional introduced across most modern day instant messaging applications.

- Privacy unravelling in online social environments (Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellowship): drawing on theory from the fields of psychology, economics, sociology, and evolutionary biology, to understand people’s online social behaviours. This work was especially interested in how people manage privacy around sensitive information in online social spaces and in particular, the impact non-disclosures can have through the social effect of privacy unravelling.
