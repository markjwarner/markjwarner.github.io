title: "Women’s use of online health and social media resources to make sense of their polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis: a qualitative study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2024-03-05-pcos
excerpt: 'We highlight the information needs and information-seeking strategies women use to make sense of how PCOS affects them, to gain emotional support, and to help them find an effective treatment. We also show how women with PCOS use online health and social media resources to compare themselves to women they view as “normal” and other women with PCOS, to find their sense of “normal for me” along a spectrum of this disorder.'
